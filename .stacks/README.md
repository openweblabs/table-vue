_For internal usage only until the beta is released by the end of ~November._

The goal of the Stacks framework is to _help you_ create & maintain frontends, backends, and clouds without having to worry about the boilerplate. Whether it's SSG pages, npm distributed & framework-agnostic component & function libraries, serverless APIs, Stacks helps you every step along the way, including production deployments and the maintenance of its related infrastructure (server or serverless).

Convention over configuration is our mantra‚Äîin beginner & expert-friendly ways.

No matter whether you are a beginner or an expert, the approachable Stacks design allows you to learn at your own pace, using our thorough documentation covering every aspect of the framework. Stacks is extremely beginner & expert-friendly.

Develop beautiful, reactive, composable UIs without learning a new set of languages. HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript‚Äîthat's all you need to dive in now! _Or TypeScript ‚úåüèº_

> _A true rapid application development framework for all Full Stack needs. Next-level simplicity & helpful DX._

## Get Started

It's incredibly easy to get started with this framework. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://stacksjs.dev/setup | sh

# alternatively, if you know pnpm is already installed, get started via:
npx stacks new my-project
```

> **Note**
> pnpm 7.16 or higher required. _Run the setup script & üê∂ Buddy will set you up. He barks otherwise._

## ü§ñ Usage

The following list includes some of the most common ways to interact with the Stacks API. Meet the toolkit, Buddy:

```bash
buddy install # installs all dependencies
buddy dev # starts one of the dev servers (components, functions, pages, or docs)
buddy build # follow CLI prompts to select which library (or server) to build
buddy commit # follow CLI prompts for committing changes
buddy release # creates the releases for the stack & consequently, publishes them to npm
buddy upgrade # auto-update deps & the Stacks framework

buddy make:component HelloWorld # scaffolds a component
buddy make:function HelloWorld # scaffolds a function
buddy make:page hello-world # scaffolds a page (https://127.0.0.1/hello-world)

buddy --help
```

<details>

```bash
buddy --version # get the Stacks version
buddy --help # view help menu
# please note: you may suffix any command with the
# `command --help` flag to review the help menu

buddy install # installs your dependencies
buddy fresh # fresh reinstall of all deps
buddy clean # removes all your deps

buddy update # auto-update deps & the Stacks framework
buddy update:dependencies # auto-update deps & the Stacks framework

## üìö Utilizing the Built Libraries

Because Stacks optimizes the development of easily reusable & composable component & function libraries, the primary intention is to always _keep it simple, yet configurable._

By default, Stacks realizes whether your Stack includes components, functions, and/or pages. Based on that determination, Stacks builds your outputs.

The UI libraries that automatically get built are: a Web Component (Custom Elements) & Vue Component library.

<details>
<summary>Web Component usage</summary>

```bash
npm install my-awesome-library
```

After you installed your Stacks generated library, you can use a "Custom Element" (Web Component) in the following way:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <hello-world name="Jane Doe"></hello-world>
    <script src="my-awesome-library.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Vue 2 & 3 usage</summary>

```bash
npm install my-awesome-library
```

After you installed your Stacks generated library, you can use your Vue Components in the following way:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import HelloWorld from 'my-awesome-library'
</script>

<template>
  <HelloWorld name="J Doe" />
</template>
```

</details>

_A function library may also be automatically generated._

<details>
<summary>Functions usage</summary>

```bash
npm install hello-world-library
```

After you installed your Stacks generated library, you can use your functions in the following way:

```ts
import { count, increment } from 'hello-world-fx'

console.log('count is', count)
increment()
console.log('increased count is', count)
```

</details>

You may view this framework as an incredibly "useful set of frames" to assist in efficiently bootstrapping, designing, and managing component & function libraries‚Äîusing industry best practices, to reach one of the broadest user bases possible.
