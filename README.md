# Vue Component Library Starter Kit

This is an opinionated Vue Component Library Starter kit to help kick-start development of your next component library.

## 💡 Get Started

It's incredibly easy to get your component library started with this slightly opinionated starter kit. The only prerequisite is a basic understanding of how to design/develop Vue Single File Components (SFCs). In other words, HTML with sprinkled JavaScript will get you really far!

```bash
# you may use this GitHub template or the following command:
npx degit meemalabs/vue-component-library-starter my-awesome-vue-component-lib
cd my-awesome-vue-component-lib

# ensure you also now update your vite.config.ts with your library name

 # if you don't have pnpm installed, run `npm i -g pnpm`
pnpm i # install all deps
pnpm dev # starts the local server at http://localhost:3333 & watches for changes
pnpm build # builds the library for production-ready use
```

Additionally, the `package.json` contains some useful snippets you likely want to be aware of.

## 🤖 Usage

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { HelloWorld } from 'my-awesome-vue-component-lib'
</script>

<template>
  <HelloWorld />
</template>
```

git add . # select the changes you want to commit
pnpm run commit # and now simply answer the questions

# after you have successfully committed, you may create a "release"
pnpm run release # automates git commits, versioning, and CHANGELOG generation
```
