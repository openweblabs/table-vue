# Vue Component Library Starter Kit

This is an opinionated Vue Component Library Starter kit to help kick-start development of your next component library.

## 💡 Get Started

It's incredibly easy to get your component library started with this slightly opinionated starter kit. You simply need to know how to design/develop Vue Single File Components.

```bash
npx degit meemalabs/vue-component-library-starter my-awesome-vue-component-lib
cd my-awesome-vue-component-lib

# ensure you also now update your vite.config.ts with your library name

 # if you don't have pnpm installed, run `npm i -g pnpm`
pnpm i # install all deps
pnpm dev # starts the local server at http://localhost:3333 & watches for changes
pnpm build # builds the library for production-ready use
```

Additionally, the `package.json` contains some useful snippets you likely want to be aware of.

## Usage

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { MyButton } from 'my-awesome-vue-component-lib'
import '/node_modules/my-awesome-vue-component-lib/dist/style.css'
</script>
```

### How To Create Releases

In order to automate package releases, this starter kit is setup to use [Semantic Commit Style](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) & GitHub Actions. Once you are ready to create a new release, simply "create a new tag" (e.g. v1.2.0). The creation of the tag will trigger a `tag-release` GitHub Action.

Lastly, login to your npm account and add your newly created repository.
